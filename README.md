# JWT Authentication in Laravel

A simple demonstration to generate and implement JWT token API authentication.

## Use case
A user logging into a web application should be able to generate an api key to authenticate apis related to the web application. In this use case the jwt token will not be created at login. It will be generated by the user after login.

## Installation
Copy the library and the middleware appropriately for this setup to work. It should work in any recent Laravel versions. 

## Credits
The JWT library used here does not belong to me. I have been using it for few years in the past but forgot from which Github repo I download. If I am not wrong it should be this one.
